    "It has been more than 60 years since Luther Cornish and his family first put a glow on the faces of Taylor's Island residents on Christmas Eve. The community saves the date each year just to hear Luther sing and lead his ever growing family in holiday song. See you Christmas Eve at Boats & Hoses on Taylor's Island.",
