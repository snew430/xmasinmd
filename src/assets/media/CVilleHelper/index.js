    "If you happen to drive by the 700 block of Frederick Road in Catonsville during the holidays, you will notice the Santa House. It's right next to the Catonsville fire station. Just outside of the Santa House is a special mailbox. That's where Santa's Catonsville Helper, Rick Brostrom picks up mail sent to Santa and “helps” Santa answer the mail. Rick has started a Go Fund Me Page  in hopes of visiting some of the children with a gift that “Santa asked him to drop off.”",
